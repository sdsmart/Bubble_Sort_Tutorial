Bubble Sort Visualition
-----------------------
This project is a way to illustrate how the bubble sort algorithm works to new coders.

It is used to walk someone through the steps of the algorithm and then
show them what that algorithm looks like while running.

### Instructions
Have the student re-create the code inside bubble_sort.py.

Then execute animation.py to visualize the algorithm.
