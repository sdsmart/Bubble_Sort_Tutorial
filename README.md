About This Repository
=====================
This project is a way to illustrate how the bubble sort algorithm works.

It is used to walk someone through the steps of the algorithm and then
show them what the algorithm they created looks like.

Instructions
------------
Have the student re-create the code inside bubble_sort.py.

Then simply execute animation.py to visualize the algorithm.
